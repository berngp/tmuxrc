# Tmux Configuration

Here lies the configuration for my [tmux][] setup. It requires at least version
1.9. If you want to load extra options afterwards, add it to
`~/.tmux.local.conf`. Iâ€™m working on having that file automatically generated
when tmux runs for the first time.

I use a lot of plugins from [`tmux-plugins`][1] to get that community-funded
work. Check them out!
